# Hey There! :wave:

### I'm Amruth Kiran, 

A Geospatial Researcher/Developer at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) in Bangalore, India. My work mostly revolves around building large-scale compute platforms on cloud services and on-premise systems using open-source GIS and Remote Sensing tools. My expertise is in:
1. Big Earth Observation (EO) management :earth_africa:, 
2. Developing custom data portals :computer:, 
3. Understanding the use-cases of various metadata protocols and,
4. Building/dessiminating spatial surveys :memo:.

## Ongoing work :building_construction:
As part of the Geospatial Lab at IIHS (motivated by personal interest as well), I'm heading the development of an institutional level Spatial Data Infrastrcuture (SDI) that aims to collate all spatial and non-spatial data generated by reseachers and developers. This SDI is fully open-source and powered by AWS and/or Azure as well as the local on-premise servers. Highlighted projects are given below, the rest will be added as and when licenses are in order.
